# Music-Genre-Classification

## Abstract
We continually strive to improve our music experience by exploring different resources. We started our music journey with radio programs and television channels and gradually used infamous websites to offline access music. Now, with the streaming platforms, we have achieved the “epitome” of satisfaction, yet, sometimes, whenever we try to explore new music, the streaming platforms cannot provide an entirely satisfactory experience to users.

We have a quandary approach towards segregating our music based on genres and style. Our objective then became to resolve this by applying machine learning techniques to categorize or cluster the music into genres and provide a mechanism for the user to explore new music based on it. By referring to many models already existing on the internet and other resources, we aim to incorporate a comprehensive range of music tastes. We do not seek to solve the issue but take a step towards an even better experience.

## Introduction
We aim to address music classification into specific musical genres through our model and further extend this into practical applications. For this, we have done a thorough research and preprocessing by displaying the human as well as computer-interpreted graphs and labels. This is accompanied by clustering and an overall idea of the music we are dealing with in our dataset. We further propose Multi Classification models for the provided music dataset to categorize it into specific music genres. We have analyzed and tested 7-8 machine learning models and thoroughly experimented to achieve the best achievable performance, including hyperparameter tuning and a performance report. We aim to pick the best model and use it for our further research and implementation.

## Dataset Description
We are using the __GTZAN__ dataset which contains a total of 1000 audio files in .wav format divided into 10 genres. Each genre has 100 songs of 30-sec duration. Along with the audio files, 2 CSV files containing features of the audio files. The files contain mean and variance calculated over multiple features that can be obtained from an audio file. The other file has the same composition, but the songs were divided into 3-second audio files.

### Audio signal feature extraction:
We convert every audio file to signals with a sampling rate to analyze its characteristics. 
Every waveform has its features in ttwo forms:
- Time domain- nothing much information about music quality can be extracted and explored apart from visual distinction in the waveforms

- Frequency domain which we get after fourier transform of two types: Spectral features and Rhythm features
#### Spectral

#### Rhythm features

MFCC and Rhythm feature plots provide a matrix based information for the unique features. Both the features have been mapped with the duration of the music file.

### Preprocessing
After extraction of features, all columns were not null. So extra values were not added.
Why is it important to preprocess the data?
- The variables will be transformed to the same scale.
- So that all continuous variables contribute equally 
- Such that no biased results 
- PCA very sensitive to variances of initial variables
 If large variance range difference between features , the one with larger range will dominate
- The boxplots of each feature shows some features have very large differences in their variances.
- PCA with both normalisation(minMaxScaler) and standardisation(StandardScaler) is done and difference noted.
 
 ## Methodology
 Feature extraction -> correlation matrix -> PCA
 - With 30 secs sample

 - With 3 secs sample

- Less outliers/ variance for some classes found in principal components:
### Inferences:
- pca.explained_variance_ratio_=[0.20054986 0.13542712]
Shows pc1 holds 20% percent of the data, pc2 holds 13% of the data
- Big clusters of metal , rock, pop ,reggae, classical can be seen.
- Jazz ,country, are separable to one extent.
- Hip-hop,disco,blues are very dispersed and can’t be seen 
- Majority are easily separable classes
- Decided to proceed to modelling phase by using 3 sec sampled feature set with standardization.

## Classification:
### Logistic
### SGD Classifier
### Gaussian NB
### KNN
### DT
- Took DT as baseline model
![](https://github.com/ashcode028/Music-Genre-Classification/blob/main/Plots_DT_ENSEMBLE/DT-ROC.png)
- Used ADA boosting which reduced the performance(rock,pop,disco)
![](https://github.com/ashcode028/Music-Genre-Classification/blob/main/Plots_DT_ENSEMBLE/ADA-ROC.png)
- Then gradient boosting which increased the accuracy exponentially.
![](https://github.com/ashcode028/Music-Genre-Classification/blob/main/Plots_DT_ENSEMBLE/GRADIENT-ROC.png)
- CatBoost was having high AUC for all genres unlike gradient which had low accuracy for some genres
